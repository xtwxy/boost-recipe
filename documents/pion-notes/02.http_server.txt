Q1. 
    How to create my own http server?
A1.
    There are many ways to create an http server.
    1. create http server with port number.

    1a. call explicit server(const unsigned int tcp_port = 0)
    1b. default scheduler, a single service scheduler will be used - single io_service and multiple threads. 

    2. create http server with http endpoint.

    2a. call explicit server(const boost::asio::ip::tcp::endpoint& endpoint)
    2b. default scheduler, a single service scheduler will be used - single io_service and multiple threads. 
    
    3. create http server with scheduler and port number.

    3a. call explicit server(scheduler& sched, const unsigned int tcp_port = 0)
    3b. user specified scheduler will be used. 

    4. create http server with scheduler and http endpoint.

    4a. call server(scheduler& sched, const boost::asio::ip::tcp::endpoint& endpoint)
    4b. user specified scheduler will be used. 
    
Q2. 
    How to share a single io_service scheduler or io_service with other tasks?

A2. 
    Depends on how to create the http server.
    1. http server is created with default single service scheduler.
    
    1a. change the access specifier from protected => public -- not recommended.
        inline boost::asio::io_service& get_io_service(void) { return m_active_scheduler.get_io_service(); }
    1b. create my http server class that publicly inheritent the http server class,
        and create a public member function that returns the io_service, 
        and delegate to pion::tcp::server::get_io_service().
    
    2. http server is create with a user specified single service scheduler.
    
    2a. call to pion::scheduler::get_io_service(), which is a public member, to directly get the io_service.
        the scheduler instance is a noncopyable public variable, which must be encapsulated with a Locator object/function.
    
    3. other cases is not under discussion.

    Therefore, case 2. is recommended.
